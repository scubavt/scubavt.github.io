# This config-file is only needed for travis production. Instead of changing the url
# everytime you work locally on the project, you start both config-files, overwriting
# the first one with the travis production variables needed.
#
# Start travis production with â€º $ jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_pro.yml
