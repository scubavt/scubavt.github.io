We host biweekly meetings for all members to catch up with each other's diving adventures and to update everyone on our plans to go diving. Our gear room is located in Room 5 of War Memorial Hall, in the basement next to the pool. 

The club goes on local trips to the New River and Blacksburg Quarry, as well as away trips to Gray Quarry in TN, Bluestone Quarry in NC, Vortex Springs in FL, the Florida Keys, etc. We also host one out of the country trip every spring break! 2016 was the Bahamas and 2017 was Cozumel, Mexico. 
Below is a map of all these dive locations that we will update any time we explore someplace new!
