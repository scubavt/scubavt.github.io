# Where do we go diving?

Everywhere! The local points are the New River and Blacksburg Quarry, but we also travel! Check out the cool map on the About Us page!

# Do I have to be certified to join?

No! We welcome all certified and non-certified divers! We can get you certified (for cheaper than any other dive shop around!) with one of our instructors.

# What levels of certifications do you offer?

Pretty much all of them! Everything from Discover Scuba and Open Water, all the way up to Scuba Instructor!

# Do you have your own gear?

Yes! In our gear room (Room 5 of War Memorial Hall) we have multiple full sets of gear that can be rented out to any member at any time!

# How do I become a member?

Visit the [membership](/membership/) tab and fill out the form! Your membership will be good for either a semester or a year, which ever you decide to commit to!
